# Economic Viability of Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling

This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the economic viability of lithium-ion battery recycling across the United States, Europe, and China. It integrates recent academic studies, industrial data, and policy developments to evaluate how regional cost structures, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure maturity influence the profitability of hydrometallurgical, pyrometallurgical, and direct recycling processes for both LFP and NMC chemistries. The study also develops a comparative economic model to assess capex, opex, material recovery, and break-even facility scales, offering an updated state-of-the-art assessment of emerging trends and financial pathways in the global LIB recycling sector.
